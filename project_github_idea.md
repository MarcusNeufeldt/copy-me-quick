Concept: GitHub Repository File Selector
Instead of uploading from local disk, the user connects the application to a GitHub repository. The app then uses the GitHub API to:
List the repository's file structure (branches, folders, files).
Display this structure in your existing FileSelector component (or a modified version).
Fetch the content of selected files directly from GitHub on demand when the user clicks "Copy Selected".
How to Implement It (High-Level):
Authentication:
OAuth: The most user-friendly and secure method. Implement a GitHub OAuth flow. When the user connects, they'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize your app, granting it permission to read repository data. Your app receives an access token.
Personal Access Token (PAT): A simpler alternative (for development or power users) is to allow users to paste a PAT with the necessary scopes (e.g., repo). This is less secure for the user, so provide clear warnings. Store the token securely (e.g., localStorage for the session, but be mindful of XSS).
UI Changes:
Add a "Connect to GitHub" section/button.
Input fields for the repository URL (or owner/repo name).
A dropdown to select the branch (fetch branches via API).
Display connection/authentication status.
GitHub API Integration:
Use the fetch API or a library like octokit to interact with the GitHub REST API.
Fetch Tree: Use the Get Tree endpoint (GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{tree_sha}?recursive=1). You'll likely start with the latest commit SHA of the chosen branch. The recursive=1 parameter is crucial as it fetches the entire file structure in one go (for most repos, very large ones might truncate).
Build File Tree: Adapt your buildFileTree logic in FileSelector.tsx to parse the response from the GitHub Tree API instead of processing local FileList. The API response provides paths, types (blob/tree), and SHAs.
Fetch File Content: When the user clicks "Copy Selected":
Iterate through the selectedFiles paths.
For each path, find its corresponding sha from the fetched tree data.
Use the Get Blob endpoint (GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/blobs/{file_sha}) to fetch the content. The content is usually Base64 encoded, so you'll need to decode it (atob() in JavaScript).
Populate the content into your data structure just before generating the text for the clipboard.
State Management: Update AppState or component state to hold GitHub-related info (repo details, branch, auth status, fetched tree data).
Refreshing: Add a "Refresh from GitHub" button that re-fetches the tree for the selected branch to get the latest file structure and SHAs.
Pros:
Solves the Sync Problem: Always fetches the latest code from the selected branch, eliminating the need for re-uploads after local edits (assuming you push your changes).
Convenience: Many developers already have their code on GitHub.
No Local Upload: Avoids potential browser performance issues related to uploading/reading large numbers of local files.
Branch Selection: Easily switch between different branches of the codebase.
Cons:
Increased Complexity: Requires implementing authentication (OAuth is non-trivial) and handling GitHub API interactions (requests, responses, error handling, rate limiting).
Authentication Required: Users must authenticate to access private repositories, and potentially even public ones depending on rate limits.
API Rate Limits: Heavy usage could hit GitHub API rate limits, especially for unauthenticated users or fetching many individual files. Authenticated requests have much higher limits.
Network Dependency: Requires a constant internet connection to browse and fetch files.
Initial Fetch Time: Fetching the tree and file contents over the network might be slower than a local upload for the initial load, depending on repo size and network speed.
Recommendation:
This is a powerful feature enhancement that directly addresses your workflow pain point.
Start with PAT Authentication: For faster development and testing, you could initially implement PAT-based access.
Implement OAuth: For a production-ready, user-friendly, and secure application, implementing the GitHub OAuth flow is the recommended approach.
Adapt FileSelector: Your existing FileSelector structure is well-suited to display the tree; you mainly need to change the data source (API response vs. local FileList) and how content is fetched (API call vs. file.text()).
It's a significant undertaking compared to tweaking the local upload flow, but it offers a much smoother experience for code hosted on GitHub.
