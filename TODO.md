Okay, I agree with the assessments. The analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the application's strengths and weaknesses, highlighting key areas for improvement in user experience, performance, clarity, and robustness. The synthesized recommendations offer a solid foundation for an implementation plan.

Here is a full implementation plan based on the provided analysis and recommendations:

**Project: Copy Me Quick - User Friendliness Enhancement Plan**

**Goal:** Implement the recommendations derived from the expert analysis to significantly improve the application's user-friendliness, performance, clarity, and robustness.

**Phase 1: Core UX Flow & Performance Bottlenecks**

*(Focus: Address the most disruptive issues and major performance problems first)*

1.  **Revamp Source Switching Logic (Local/GitHub)**
    *   **Problem:** Hard reset on tab switch is disruptive and leads to potential data loss.
    *   **Solution:** Maintain separate states for the last active project in each tab. Prompt user only if switching *while* work is in progress.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Modify `app/page.tsx`:
            *   Introduce separate state variables to hold the `AppState` for the last active local project and the last active GitHub project (e.g., `localAppState`, `githubAppState`).
            *   Update `handleTabChangeAttempt`: Check if the *current* active tab has unsaved selections/analysis. If so, show the `AlertDialog`. If not, switch `activeSourceTab` directly and load the corresponding state (`localAppState` or `githubAppState`) into the main `state` variable.
            *   Update `confirmTabSwitch`: Remove the full `handleResetWorkspace` call. Instead, just proceed with the tab switch, potentially offering to save the current selection as a preset.
            *   Modify `useEffect` hooks saving/loading state to handle the separate states if necessary, or ensure the active `state` always reflects the current tab's context correctly before save.
        *   Update `components/ui/alert-dialog` usage in `page.tsx`: Modify the text in `AlertDialogDescription` to be less about clearing everything and more about switching context, offering a save-preset option if relevant.
    *   **Affected Files:** `app/page.tsx`, `components/types.ts` (potentially, if state structure changes significantly).

2.  **Implement Lazy Loading for GitHub File Content**
    *   **Problem:** Fetching all file content upfront after loading the tree is slow for large repositories.
    *   **Solution:** Fetch file content only when needed (e.g., for token calculation of selected files, user preview, or final copy action).
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Modify `app/api/github/content/route.ts`: Ensure this route remains efficient for fetching single file content via path or SHA.
        *   Modify `app/page.tsx` (`handleBranchChange`):
            *   Remove the loop that fetches content for *all* blobs after the tree is loaded.
            *   Store the fetched tree structure (`githubTree`) containing only paths, SHAs, types, and sizes.
            *   *Defer* content fetching.
        *   Modify `components/FileSelector.tsx`:
            *   Implement logic within `useTokenCalculator` (or a new fetching mechanism) to fetch content *only* for currently selected files when the token count needs calculation. Add loading indicators during this fetch.
            *   (Optional Enhancement) Implement an on-demand fetch if a file preview feature were added.
        *   Modify `components/fileSelectorUtils.ts` / `hooks/useClipboardCopy.ts`: Ensure the `copySelectedFiles` function fetches the content for all selected files just before preparing the clipboard text. Add appropriate loading states (`setLoadingStatus`).
    *   **Affected Files:** `app/page.tsx`, `components/FileSelector.tsx`, `hooks/useTokenCalculator.ts`, `hooks/useClipboardCopy.ts`, potentially `api/github/content/route.ts` (review, likely no changes needed).

3.  **Refine AI Smart Select Interaction**
    *   **Problem:** AI suggestion replaces selection destructively and lacks transparency.
    *   **Solution:** Change to a suggestion model, highlighting proposed files and requiring user confirmation.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Modify `app/api/ai-smart-select/route.ts`: No change needed in the API response itself (still returns `selectedFiles`).
        *   Modify `components/FileSelector.tsx` (`handleAiSuggest`):
            *   On receiving the AI response (`data.selectedFiles`), do *not* call `onSelectedFilesChange` immediately.
            *   Instead, store the suggested file paths in a temporary state variable (e.g., `aiSuggestions`).
            *   Trigger a UI change to highlight these suggested files in the tree (pass `aiSuggestions` down to `FileTreeNodeMemo`).
            *   Display "Accept Suggestions" and "Discard Suggestions" buttons.
            *   "Accept" calls `onSelectedFilesChange(validSuggestions)`.
            *   "Discard" clears the `aiSuggestions` state and removes highlights.
        *   Modify `components/FileTreeNode.tsx`: Add logic to visually distinguish highlighted AI suggestions (e.g., different background color, icon).
        *   Update `Brain` icon tooltip in `FileSelector.tsx` to "Get AI file suggestions".
    *   **Affected Files:** `components/FileSelector.tsx`, `components/FileTreeNode.tsx`.

**Phase 2: UI Clarity, Feedback, and State Management**

*(Focus: Improve UI organization, user feedback mechanisms, and frontend architecture)*

4.  **Enhance Feature Discoverability & UI Clarity**
    *   **Problem:** Presets and Template Editor are hidden. File Selector toolbar is dense. Tab naming confusing.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Modify `components/FileSelector.tsx`:
            *   Relocate the "Presets" (`BookMarked` icon) functionality. Consider a more prominent button in the header or a dedicated section. Use text label "Presets".
            *   Group toolbar actions logically (e.g., Tree Ops, Selection Ops, Copy). Use `<DropdownMenu>` for less frequent actions if needed.
            *   Add clear tooltips to all icon buttons.
        *   Modify `components/ProjectSelector.tsx`: Add a text label "Edit Template" next to the `Pencil` icon button or make the button itself wider with text.
        *   Modify `components/AnalysisResult.tsx`:
            *   Rename the `TabsTrigger` value="tree" to "Selected Tree" or similar.
            *   Consider if this tab is truly necessary or if its functionality can be integrated elsewhere (e.g., a filter/mode in the main `FileSelector`).
    *   **Affected Files:** `components/FileSelector.tsx`, `components/ProjectSelector.tsx`, `components/AnalysisResult.tsx`, `app/page.tsx` (if moving preset buttons).

5.  **Improve Loading States and Error Feedback**
    *   **Problem:** Generic loading/error messages lack context and actionability.
    *   **Solution:** Provide specific messages and use consistent UI for errors.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Review all calls to `setLoadingStatus` in `app/page.tsx`, `components/FileSelector.tsx`, `components/AnalysisResult.tsx`, `components/FileUploadSection.tsx`. Update messages to be specific (e.g., "Loading GitHub tree...", "Calculating tokens...", "AI analyzing...").
        *   Review all calls to `setError`, `setGithubError`, `setAiError`. Enhance error messages to be more user-friendly and suggest next steps where possible.
        *   Standardize error display: Consistently use the `Alert` component (`variant="destructive"`) near the action that caused the error.
        *   Implement specific error catching for GitHub API calls (e.g., 404, 401, 403, 429 rate limit) in the frontend fetch handlers and display targeted messages.
    *   **Affected Files:** `app/page.tsx`, `components/FileSelector.tsx`, `components/AnalysisResult.tsx`, `components/FileUploadSection.tsx`.

6.  **Implement Instant Token Count Feedback**
    *   **Problem:** Token count updates might lag behind user selection actions.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure token calculation is triggered immediately on selection change and updates the UI promptly.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Review `hooks/useTokenCalculator.ts`: Ensure the calculation logic is triggered efficiently by changes in `selectedFiles`.
        *   Optimize the calculation: If fetching content lazily (from Phase 1), ensure the calculation updates incrementally or shows an intermediate "Calculating..." state if fetches are required. Prioritize responsiveness.
        *   Ensure the `tokenCount` state update propagates quickly to the `AnalysisResult` display.
    *   **Affected Files:** `hooks/useTokenCalculator.ts`, `components/FileSelector.tsx`, `components/AnalysisResult.tsx`.

7.  **Refactor State Management & Component Structure**
    *   **Problem:** `app/page.tsx` is overly large and manages too much state. `FileSelector` and `AnalysisResult` have overlapping concerns.
    *   **Solution:** Extract logic into custom hooks and decompose components.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Create custom hooks:
            *   `useGitHubData`: Manages GitHub auth status, fetching repos/branches/tree, associated loading/error states.
            *   `useProjectState`: Manages the core `AppState` (analysisResult, selectedFiles, filters, etc.) for the *active* project context.
            *   `useLocalStoragePersistence`: Encapsulates logic for saving/loading projects, templates, and current project ID to/from localStorage.
        *   Refactor `app/page.tsx`: Replace direct `useState`/`useEffect` logic with these custom hooks. Simplify the component's responsibility to orchestration and layout.
        *   Decompose `components/FileSelector.tsx`: Extract sub-components like `FileTree`, `FileSearchInput`, `FileSelectorToolbar`.
        *   Decompose `components/AnalysisResult.tsx`: Clarify its role. It should primarily *display* analysis data. Move interactive elements like the `FileSelector` itself out if it makes the structure clearer (though keeping selection close to results might be okay if UI is cleaned up).
    *   **Affected Files:** `app/page.tsx`, `components/FileSelector.tsx`, `components/AnalysisResult.tsx`, create new files in `hooks/`.

**Phase 3: API Robustness & Interaction Refinements**

*(Focus: Harden the backend, refine interactions like presets and search)*

8.  **Strengthen API Error Handling & GitHub Proxy**
    *   **Problem:** API errors lack standard structure. GitHub rate limits aren't handled. AI parsing is brittle.
    *   **Solution:** Standardize error formats, add rate limit handling, improve AI response parsing.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Define a standard error JSON structure (e.g., `{ error: { code: string, message: string, details?: any } }`).
        *   Update all `catch` blocks in `/api/**/route.ts` files to return errors in this standardized format using `NextResponse.json(...)`.
        *   Modify GitHub API fetching logic (ideally centralized in a server-side utility): Detect `429 Too Many Requests` responses, potentially read `Retry-After` header, and return a specific error code/message (`RATE_LIMITED`).
        *   Modify `api/ai-smart-select/route.ts`:
            *   Wrap `JSON.parse(cleanedMessage)` in a `try...catch` block.
            *   Add validation logic to check if the parsed response is actually an array of strings. Return a specific error if parsing/validation fails.
            *   Consider using a more robust method if available (e.g., checking model capabilities for structured output/function calling).
        *   Centralize GitHub API fetch logic used across `/api/github/*` routes into a reusable function within the `api` directory to handle authentication, base URL, default headers, and basic error checking consistently.
    *   **Affected Files:** All files in `app/api/`, potentially create a new utility file like `app/api/github/utils.ts`.

9.  **Refine File Tree Interaction & Search**
    *   **Problem:** Search highlighting could be clearer. Token contribution isn't visualized directly.
    *   **Solution:** Improve highlighting, consider adding per-file token estimates.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Modify `components/FileTreeNode.tsx`:
            *   Make search result highlighting (`highlightSearch` prop, currently using `animate-pulse-subtle`) more visually distinct (e.g., persistent background colour change, stronger border).
            *   (Optional/Advanced) Add logic to display a lazily calculated token estimate for individual files on hover or next to the file name. This requires the `tiktoken` encoder to be available and efficient calculation.
    *   **Affected Files:** `components/FileTreeNode.tsx`, `components/FileSelector.tsx` (passing search term/highlight state).

10. **Enhance Preset Management**
    *   **Problem:** Preset management UI is basic.
    *   **Solution:** Allow previewing preset contents.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Modify `components/NamedSelectionsManager.tsx`: Add functionality to show the list of file paths associated with a selected preset within the dialog before loading/deleting/renaming.
        *   Modify `components/FileSelector.tsx`: Ensure the `NamedSelectionsManager` receives the necessary data and callbacks.
    *   **Affected Files:** `components/NamedSelectionsManager.tsx`, `components/FileSelector.tsx`.

**Phase 4: Testing and Documentation**

11. **Testing**
    *   Add unit tests for utility functions (`fileSelectorUtils.ts`, new hooks).
    *   Add integration tests for core user flows (local upload, GitHub connect & load, AI suggest, copy output).
    *   Perform manual cross-browser testing.
    *   Test edge cases (empty folders, large files, network errors, API errors, invalid user input).

12. **Documentation**
    *   Update README with new features and improved workflow.
    *   Add inline code comments for complex logic, especially in custom hooks and state management.
    *   Document the standardized API error format.

This plan breaks down the work into logical phases, starting with the highest-impact UX and performance fixes. Each task identifies the components involved and the necessary changes, providing a clear roadmap for development.
