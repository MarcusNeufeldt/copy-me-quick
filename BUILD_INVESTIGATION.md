# Build Investigation Report

## Issue Summary

The project was experiencing build failures with Next.js during static site generation (SSG) with the following error:

```
Error occurred prerendering page "/". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/prerender-error
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'entryCSSFiles')
```

Later, after some fixes, the error changed to:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'clientModules')
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Next.js Version Compatibility
- **Next.js 15.3.0** was causing internal build errors during prerendering
- The error `entryCSSFiles` and `clientModules` are internal Next.js properties that were undefined during the build process
- This appears to be a compatibility issue with Next.js 15.x and the current dependency setup

### Secondary Issues
1. **API Routes using cookies during static generation**
   - Routes like `/api/user/templates` and `/api/user/context` were trying to be statically generated but used cookies
   - These routes needed `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static generation

2. **Complex client-side dependencies**
   - Heavy use of browser-specific APIs and complex state management
   - Vercel Analytics and SpeedInsights imports during SSR

## Investigation Steps Taken

### 1. Component Simplification
- Created minimal test pages (`page-minimal.tsx`, `page-simple.tsx`)
- Removed complex context providers and state management
- Isolated the issue to rule out component complexity

### 2. Dynamic Import Attempts
- Tried wrapping main page component in `NextDynamic` with `ssr: false`
- Added `'use client'` directives
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to various components

### 3. Route Structure Analysis
- Investigated route group structure `app/(main)/`
- Tested direct page implementation without route groups
- Confirmed the issue wasn't related to route structure

### 4. Next.js Configuration Changes
- Modified `next.config.js` with various settings
- Added error boundaries and client wrappers
- Attempted to disable SSR entirely

## Solution Found

### Downgrading Next.js Version
The issue was resolved by downgrading from Next.js 15.3.0 to 14.2.5:

```bash
npm install next@14.2.5
```

### Additional Fixes Required
1. **API Routes**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to:
   - `app/api/user/templates/route.ts`
   - `app/api/user/context/route.ts`

2. **Main Page**: Added dynamic export to prevent static generation:
   ```typescript
   export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
   ```

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- Build completes successfully with Next.js 14.2.5
- Basic page rendering works
- API routes are properly configured for dynamic rendering

### ⚠️ Partially Working
- Main complex page still has prerendering issues with `clientModules` error
- Simplified pages work correctly
- Static generation works for simple components

### ❌ Still Failing
- Full application with complex context and state management
- The original main page with `useAppManager` hook and heavy dependencies

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Stay with Next.js 14.2.5** until the complex page issues are resolved
2. **Use the simplified page** as a temporary solution
3. **Gradually add back complexity** to identify the specific problematic component

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Refactor state management** to be more SSR-friendly
2. **Reduce client-side dependencies** during initial render
3. **Implement proper loading states** for complex components
4. **Consider server components** where appropriate

### Code Changes Made
1. Downgraded Next.js version in `package.json`
2. Added dynamic exports to API routes
3. Created error boundaries and client wrappers
4. Improved hydration handling with client-side mounting checks

## Files Modified During Investigation

### Core Files
- `app/page.tsx` - Root page with dynamic imports
- `app/(main)/page.tsx` - Main application page
- `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added hydration warnings

### New Files Created
- `app/(main)/_components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error boundary component
- `app/(main)/_components/ClientWrapper.tsx` - Client-side wrapper
- `app/(main)/page-minimal.tsx` - Minimal test page
- `app/(main)/page-simple.tsx` - Simplified test page

### API Routes Fixed
- `app/api/user/templates/route.ts` - Added dynamic export
- `app/api/user/context/route.ts` - Added dynamic export

## Warnings Still Present

### ESLint Warnings
```
./app/(main)/_hooks/useAppManager.ts
148:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'userContext'

./components/LocalTemplateManager.tsx
156:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'loadTemplates'
```

### WebAssembly Warning
```
./node_modules/tiktoken/tiktoken_bg.wasm
The generated code contains 'async/await' because this module is using "asyncWebAssembly".
However, your target environment does not appear to support 'async/await'.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the remaining clientModules error** by identifying the specific component causing issues
2. **Gradually restore the full application** by adding components back one by one
3. **Address ESLint warnings** for better code quality
4. **Consider upgrading to Next.js 15** once the underlying issues are resolved
5. **Implement proper error handling** for production deployment

## Lessons Learned

1. **Next.js version compatibility** is critical for complex applications
2. **Static generation** can fail with complex client-side dependencies
3. **Dynamic imports** don't always solve SSR issues
4. **API routes using cookies** need explicit dynamic configuration
5. **Incremental debugging** is essential for complex build issues
